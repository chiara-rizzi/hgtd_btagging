first you need to run PrintRoc
python PrintROC.py <outFolder>  <fileName> or <folderName>
once you have run over the 4 configurations, you will have 4 outFloders produced by this code
then you can run:
CompareROC_4.py

in CompareROC_4:
taggerList=["MV1"]#,"IP3D","IP2D","SV1","JetFitter","MV2c10","MV2c20"]
add IP3D+SV1
and possibly also in PrintROC
